Riven X instructions for building ffmpeg.

Copy the build-arch.sh and build-rivenx.sh scripts to a ffmpeg source tree and run
build-rivenx.sh. Copy the contents of the pkgroot directory into this directory
once the build completes.

You will need Xcode and yasm. Install Xcode from the App Store or
https://developer.apple.com. Install yasm using a package manager (such as
Homebrew http://brew.sh) or from source.
